## Executive Summary
The project objective is to build a predictive model for sentences. The model will give recommendations of words that the user could choose after writing a couple of words. The model is then deployed using the Shiny platform from R. 

## Project Timeline
Since the specialization required some milestones before the overall project, you can find the first report including the steps that I took to do exploratory data analysis and data cleaning on the first report. For the modeling process, the documentation for the process is written in the second part of the reports.
